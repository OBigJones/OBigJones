ðŸ‘‹ Hi there
I am JoÃ£o Paulo Dutra, and I have been working as a software engineer for over 3 years. I am passionate about sharing knowledge. My primary language is C#, but like any good technology enthusiast, I always enjoy challenging myself by learning new things.

ðŸš€ Expertise
I like to say that I'm a professional who cares about delivering solutions that I would want to use myself. Despite my relatively short career, I work at a software consultancy serving various clients, so I've already been through some significant projects and learned a lot along the way. It all began with my love for testing, which I discovered early on in my first major project, and it grew into a passion for teaching and sharing knowledge, which I believe is the best way to learn.

My primary focus in my career has been to develop products capable of delivering the highest value to the customer. To achieve this, I made sure to delve into Clean Architecture, Clean Code, SOLID principles, and design patterns that enable me to do so, thus building a solid foundation for developing solutions.

Currently, I am a Technical Lead of a team that works directly on creating solutions and products for end-users.
